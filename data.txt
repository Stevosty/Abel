Aqueous Cream
Aqueous cream is a non-greasy emollient or moisturiser, used to treat dry skin conditions such as eczema.  It is made from a mixture of emulsifying ointment and water (also called oil in water emulsion). When used as a soap substitute or wash product, it works by providing a layer of oil on the surface of the skin, which traps water beneath it and  prevents water evaporating from the skin surface. In this way it helps to retain moisture on the skin and reduce dryness. Read more about emollients and moisturisers.
